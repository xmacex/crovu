VU for crow

## Documentation

    → 1 input
      1 rms ≥ 1V →
      2 rms ≥ 2V →
      3 rms ≥ 3V →
      4 rms ≥ 4V →

Listens to root mean square (RMS) volume of input 1 and as it gets louder turns on more and more of the outputs. Like a VU meter for crow; a cro-VU.

It's kind of upside down for a VU meter since the outputs are organized top-down on the crow panel. But crows are playful and I bet you all have seen the video of the australian crows hanging upside down. So you can think of that.

There are a few public variables for setting the true and false vvoltages if you are into that sort of thing.
